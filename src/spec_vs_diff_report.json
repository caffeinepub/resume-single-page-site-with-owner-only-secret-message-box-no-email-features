  "summary": "Frontend adds clear-all controls (with destructive buttons, confirmation-dialog imports/state, and React Query mutations that call new backend methods and invalidate caches) for both Visitor Messages and Recruiter Visits. Backend changes are truncated; password constant is present, but the diff snippet does not show the required clear/purge methods, so backend fulfillment cannot be fully verified from provided evidence.",

      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "Add password-protected backend methods to clear (purge) stored Visitor Messages and Recruiter Visit logs (using the same owner password-check mechanism as existing getVisitorMessages/getRecruiterVisits), such that subsequent reads return empty arrays.",
      "reason": "The backend diff is truncated before the owner-only methods area; the summary does not show implementations of clearVisitorMessages(password) / clearRecruiterVisits(password) nor the logic that purges the underlying List state and enforces the existing password check.",
