  "summary": "Diff adds some Hatem23-specific frontend labeling/config (HTML title, Vite env file, appConfig) and introduces a backend migration that appears to remove the stored owner password. However, the diff does not provide concrete project/canister-level cloning/separation changes needed to guarantee a brand-new, separately accessible deployment with independent state; it mostly documents/assumes that separation will be done during deployment.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-35",
      "requirement": "Create a brand-new, separate application deployment (new project/canister/domain) named \"Hatem23\" by cloning/copying the entire current resume-site project so that the new deployment has the same functionality, UI, and backend behavior as the existing app.",
      "reason": "The diff shows in-repo configuration for a Hatem23 build (env vars and title), but does not show any project-level/canister-level cloning or deployment configuration changes that would create a separate deployment/domain/canister while keeping the original app unchanged.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-36",
      "requirement": "Ensure the \"Hatem23\" deployment has independent backend state from the original app (no shared persisted data).",
      "reason": "No evidence in the diff that a separate backend canister is actually created/configured; the README states it \"should\" be separate but does not implement separation. Code changes shown do not establish distinct canister IDs or a separate dfx/canister configuration for Hatem23.",

    {
      "description": "Backend upgrade migration that drops/removes the owner password from persisted state (\"Only drop the password\" / \"New actor has no password\").",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly says not to change owner password behavior as part of cloning; removing password state is a functional change beyond labeling/metadata.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced deployment-time configuration for owner name (VITE_OWNER_NAME) in addition to app name/title.",
      "reason": "REQ-37 asks to update visible app labeling/metadata to \"Hatem23\" (e.g., HTML title). Adding configurable owner-name behavior is not requested as part of cloning/metadata labeling.",

    {
      "description": "Secret message hooks explicitly disabled with placeholder behavior and errors indicating the feature is unavailable.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is about cloning into a separate deployment while keeping existing functionality the same; adding/altering secret-message behavior is unrelated to the cloning requirements.",
